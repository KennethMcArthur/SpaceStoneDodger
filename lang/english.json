"LEVEL002": "Our job is to collect metal scraps from space and then sell it for money, it ain't much but it's honest work, like my grand-grand-father used to say on Earth.",
"LEVEL003": "Today we detected an unusual asteroid activity not far from Quasari Station, this means that we'll surely find a lot of metal parts around there (you know, impacts).\nWe just need to collect as much scraps as we can, and with a Station nearby we could sell the stuff there.",
"LEVEL004": "Avoid asteroids and don't get hit too much.\nWe can handle a couple of hits, but three strikes and we're out. So try your best.\nOnward to Quasari Station, then.",
"LEVEL005": "Watch out! Lots of stones ahead!",
"LEVEL006": "Watch out! An even bigger group ahead!",
"LEVEL007": "Almost there, but here's a HUGE group!",

"LEVEL009": "Well, that's weird. I mean: who'd leave all this stuff right next to the station?!",
"LEVEL010": "Wait...",
"LEVEL011": "Oh my...we're not close to the station: this IS the station, or what is left.",
"LEVEL012": "There's no way it's just an accident, We're definitely not safe here.\nLet's go and FAST, we'll figure out what happened later.",
